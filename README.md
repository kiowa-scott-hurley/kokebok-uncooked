# Kokebok

A place to store my recipes with version control and internet access! 

This git pages is a copy of [Nyum](https://github.com/doersino/nyum) which I think is lovely and easy to set up. 

You can find a recipe template in recipe.template for when you forget where everything is. 

Licensing info from original repo is intact here.

## License

You may use this repository's contents under the terms of the *MIT License*, see `LICENSE`.

However, the subdirectories `_assets/fonts/` and `_assets/tabler-icons` contain **third-party software with its own licenses**:

* The sans-serif typeface [**Barlow**](https://github.com/jpt/barlow) is licensed under the *SIL Open Font License Version 1.1*, see `_assets/fonts/barlow/OFL.txt`.
* [**Lora**](https://github.com/cyrealtype/Lora-Cyrillic), the serif typeface used in places where Barlow isn't, is also licensed under the *SIL Open Font License Version 1.1*, see `_assets/fonts/lora/OFL.txt`.
* The icons (despite having been modified slightly) are part of [**Tabler Icons**](https://tabler-icons.io), they're licensed under the *MIT License*, see `_assets/tabler-icons/LICENSE.txt`. The placeholder image shown on the index page for recipes that don't have their own image if the `show_images_on_index` option is enabled also makes use of these icons.

Finally, some **shoutouts** that aren't *really* licensing-related, but fit better here than anywhere else in this document:

* The device mockups used to spice up the screenshots in this document are from [Facebook Design](https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/devices/).
* Because you're dying to know this, let me tell you that the screenshots' background image is based on a [Google Maps screenshot of a lithium mining operation in China](https://twitter.com/doersino/status/1324367617763676160).
* I've designed the logo using a previous project of mine, the [Markdeep Diagram Drafting Board](https://doersino.github.io/markdeep-diagram-drafting-board/).
